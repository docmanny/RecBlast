========

This repo contains two modules, RecBlast and RecBlastMP. Recblast is a modules that can do Reciprocal-Best-Hit-BLAST searches between two species, given a list of sequences. RecBlastMP is a work-in-progress that simply adapts RecBlast into a object-oriented, multiprocess framework for efficiency.
