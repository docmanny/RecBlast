Miscellaneous-Code
===================
This repo holds all of the code that hasn't found its way into a dedicated repository yet. As my default, its purpose is to simply
back up all my code of value in a general fashion. 

Functions contained within:
----------------------
- All of my BioSQL wrappers;
- RecBlast and all associated functions (which, now that its fully functional, will get its own repo);
- RecBlastMP, which is a multiprocess-enabled RecBlast (aka RecBlast2.0).
